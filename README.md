rest_api_demo
=============

This repository contains boilerplate code for a RESTful API based on Flask and Flask-RESTPlus adopted to be used for a widget selling site.

The code of this demo app is based loosely on an article on the blog (I like swagger, this was a good way to get it incorporated quickly):
http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2016/06/19/building-beautiful-restful-apis-using-flask-swagger-ui-flask-restplus/

Designed to run on Python 3 in virtual env, Flask runs on port 8888 of localhost.

Swagger API Docs: https://localhost:8888/api/
Widgets API: https://localhost:8888/api/widgets/
    API Areas (categories, orders, widgets)

HTML in static folder can be run local. Uses JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and Knockout for the most part.

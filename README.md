rest_api_demo
=============

This repository contains boilerplate code for a RESTful API based on Flask and Flask-RESTPlus adopted to be used for a widget selling site.

The code of this demo app is based loosely on an article on the blog (I like swagger, this was a good way to get it incorporated quickly):
